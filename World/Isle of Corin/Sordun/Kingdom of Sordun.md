### Disbandment

[[The Kingdom of Sordun]] was dissolved on the 23rd day of Cailleach's Breath of the year 243 AR following the election of the **Democratic Council of Thraldur**.

### Demography and Population

Founded some time ago before the beginning of _the Arcane Deprivation_, [[The _Kingdom of Sordun_]] is believed to have been one of the first civilizations established on the [Isle of Corin](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/isle-of-corin-article). Due to the lack of historic records kept, no one can say for certain exactly when Humans first found themselves on the island. At the beginning, it was a prosperous Kingdom, powerful and just.   Due to the results of [The Arcane Rebellion](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/the-arcane-rebellion-article)  the capital city of [Thraldur](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/thraldur-article) and its surrounding villages have had many other races begin to flood toward them. The capital city itself has many Halfling refugees amass at the city gates, seeking refuge and compensation for damages caused to the halfling province of _Tolfen_.   In the past, the inner city of [Thraldur](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/thraldur-article) was restricted to a purely human population, however, the slum settlement just outside the main gate into the city is largely populated by humans, but races such as half-elves could also be found there.

### Territories

The **_Kingdom of Sordun_** occupies the North-Eastern section of the [Isle of Corin](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/isle-of-corin-article) consisting of seven settlements, including the capital city of [Thraldur](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/thraldur-article).

### Religion

In the past, the worship of any divine being, and use of any type of magic is prohibited. Those caught breaking these laws may be found guilty of treason and consequently, put to death. But due to the recent occupation by the wood elves, divine worship and arcane practice has now been made legal once more.
