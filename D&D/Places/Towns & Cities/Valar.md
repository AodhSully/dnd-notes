High Elf Capital

---
Once the elves arrived on [Isle of Corin](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/isle-of-corin-article) they began to look for suitable locations for their kin to settle. The high-elves looked north, to the mountains on the western coast of the island. The mountaintops seemed a very fitting location for the high-elves, where they could be closest to the sun, and their griffons could nest close to the peaks.
