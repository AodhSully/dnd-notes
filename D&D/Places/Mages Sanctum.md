### Purpose / Function

The Sanctum was constructed long before the times of _the [[Arcane Purge]],_ back when casters and divine worshippers lived in peace and harmony throughout the kingdom. Its purpose was to provide a sanctuary to like-minded mages who would focus their studies on magic that could prove beneficial to the future of the land.

### History

Founded by the great wizard _[[Elandor Thrane]],_ who once served as a court wizard to _[[King Aldurin Thamar]]_ of the [Human Kingdom of Sordun](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/human-kingdom-of-sordun-article). _The Sanctum_ became a ruin during the year _30 AD_, due to a siege during _the [[Arcane Purge]]._ It was inhabited by a dragon cult during the year 141 AR who were then 'evicted' by [Jantle Beaugarde](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/jantle-beaugarde-person) during _the Shift._ A short time after, mages that returned to the [Human Kingdom of Sordun](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/human-kingdom-of-sordun-article) began to rebuild _the Sanctum_, and it became a safe space for practitioners to educate themselves in the way of the arcane arts...and to try out any of the more 'experimental' magics.
