#town 
is in the mountain
extends to a cliff edge
on a flat portion
ease of access to the mountain
does not seem to be chipped away at
mining does not happen in the town itself

moderate guard barracks
dungeon
a bathhouse not far from the gates
some houses/cottages scattered around
start to form a street or two eventually
nice general store
over by the ledge as you go down the 1 main street
you see a manor, some may sat precariously perched
nice balconies view out over the valley
a perch you can walk out on to
fences around what would be the garden
2 carriages parked out front
nice big cursive letters over the gate that say Piffington
