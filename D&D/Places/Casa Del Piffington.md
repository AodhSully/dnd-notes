in [[Ryllyren]]
its built of stone
nice Icey embellishment
6 pillars out front
over the door a depiction of white dragon
parts of the house look like they made of ice
house has been there a while
there's 3 floors including loft and high peaked roof
2 towers at the back at each corner of the house
inside: there's a rug rolled out
not what you would expect of a manor or palace
its a pelt - stitched together - some sort of white pelt
looks nice and neat
ice everything in the house
a double stairwell a few feet from entry
as it splits into 2 to go to each side it looks a bit snake like, not quite winding
it breaks off into 2
snakes up like someone would draw branches of a tree
a little steep
there are many many doors to accommodate the large family that lives here
few suits of armour, some made of ice
