### Structure

_The Thunderfucks_ do not have a formal hierarchy, from the very start they always shared responsibility and made their decisions according to the majority of the party. Although, whenever they got a new member they would be referred to as _'Intern'_ until the party decided that they had proven themselves. If there was a task the rest of the party would rather not do, it was given to _the intern_.  
  

### Assets

The party is known to carry many magic items, but not much is known of their exact wealth in currency.
