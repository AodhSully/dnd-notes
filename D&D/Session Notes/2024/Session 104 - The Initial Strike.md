I summon a raven [[Ouoth]] 

[[Piff]] + [[Aranelle]] have a tough nights sleep
	first we see the village we are in from overhead
	we hear the river
	next image
	looking at the river mouth
	back beside the village, we see an arcane cannon
	we see the runes pule with a white light, big boom
	don't wee what it shot at
	vision then sinks into the ground
	through the river
	then darkness
	next vision
	see inches from our faces
	an ore, in the darkness
	start drifting back
	the ore shifts
	we see the [[Turask]]
	2 horns made of strange metallic substance on its head
	hear the boom again, muffled
	the [[Turask]] shifts, and opens its eyes
	once one of the eyes opens
	it fixes it gaze looking directly at us
	sniff as if taking in a scent

we both awake 
this know of impending doom turning
cant shake the feeling what we saw should it come out from its slumber
it will chase us down!
