Battling bushes

make it through the night to the stronghold
we can hear shuffling of feet closer to the entrance
its defo been abandoned long ago, but its more than nature reclaiming the place

There's a dense mist covering the ground... green and black in colour emanating from the stronghold

The fog is poison? [[Py]] takes a breath of it
the fog is slimy, rotting taste in your mouth, itchy eyes


walls of the fort are 30ft high
what ever gates were there are no more

[[Aranelle]] jumps off the wall
[[Tardon]] is grappled by evil vines


wrapped in vines
