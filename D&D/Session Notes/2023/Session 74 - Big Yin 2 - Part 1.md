Deckheads waited in Thraldur for 2 weeks

Everything "Seems to be fine" in [[Gabel]] as far as the [[Deckheads]] know

There are 2 war ships in [[Gabel]] and 4/5 sailing ships that can be utilised to carry troops and weapons. Not sure of any others
There is a barricade around the city using the ships, civilian ships are in the docks
some ships are pointing weapons towards the city
They have arcane cannons
most of the ships are aiming outwards away from the city
a few are aimed at the city
ships belong to the [[Court of Themus]]

[[Sir Morrow]] is elderly dude that lives in [[Thraldur]]

[[Relyth]] green skin, exaturated elven features, a bit weird, very long pointed ears

The ruptured what the slippery eel
Drew a map of Gable with my Emerald pen to everyone else it looks like gable
To [[Jock]] it looks like him as an old man

[[Capitan Dunbar]] from [[Gabel]], [[Solace]] sent him, left his ship in [[Porthladd]]

Making Plans:
	- Sail from Porthladd on [[Capitan Dunbar]]s ship
	- jump in the water as we sail past the big ships, drink water potions
	- climb the anchor chain
	- kill the crew
	- take the ships
	- ???
	- Stuff happens
	- ???
	- Gable is now free!

[[Oraculum]] shows up in human form and says the [[Turask]] probably isn't important right now before returning to weapon form

Hit them at dawn!

Back to the palace for the night


[[Piff]] gives a servant of the palace a bunch of flowers and says: _
	*These are from [[Enva]] please give them to [[Antigone]], and tell her, [[Enva]] is worried she might not make it back from [[Gabel]] and wanted to give them as a parting gift*

[[Ollukaar]] woken in the morning and taken to the council
