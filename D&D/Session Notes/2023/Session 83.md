Off to [[Ryllyren]] to sort out the kerfuffle at the homestead,

Notice about the homestead:
	In [[Ryllyren]] small settlement has chipped away at the ice that revealed a tunnel
	inside the tunnel it is totally silent - still echoes
	Want people to go investigate
	"novice quest" - *allegedly* 

[[Aranelle]] drinks the full vial of sleepy juice she got from the creepy lady loitering around the graveyard

[[Enva]] gets trashed - starts to float away - gets tied with some rope - is now a helium balloon

[[Ollukaar]] sees a shift in the show

[[Remorhaz]] - arctic predator that thrive in cold climates

[[Remorhaz]] AC ~ 15 hits
Not even 1 round - Pah!!!
[[Ryder]] got the kill

Got some bits from it including a spine and 2 meals worth of food


Meanwhile - in [[Aranelle]]s head
	voice of [[Dendar]]:
		Why don't you sit down?
		I will let you wake once we have struck a deal
		I have so much I can offer you
		what could you gain from some glorified dragon sitting ion his pedestal doing nothing of greatness	
		The is much I can offer you
		especially with 1. especially with the item your party has (evil book)
        he was trying to persuade me to come to the darkness once more now that i made amends
	    and probably use said book

[[Aranelle]] - so now, because I denied him once more, he gave me uncontrollable tremors and tics. I have disadvantage for str and dex saving throws

[[Ryder]] takes watch and sees long creepy arms pulling them selves out of [[Eryl]]s bag of holding

[[Mr. Bag Man]] beastie is about 15ft tall
you can see every detail of the bones under its skin

	shouts - "***MARVEL IN THE KINGDOM***"
	Is after the [[Teardrop Gemstone]]

AC - 15 hits --- 11 no hit
he dropped beads from a necklace of fireballs - fucked a bunch of us

	May have heard tales of a creature that lives in bags of holding, not sure what it was other then that

[[Py]] gets the [[Teardrop Gemstone]] out of its hand
[[Enva]] tries to glue the monster to a giant boulder with some [[sovereign glue]]
as [[Pinecone]] bites him again we see that his previous wounds have stitched them selves back up
we see glowing red beads in his hands

May have heard tales of a creature that lives in bags of holding, not sure what it was other then that

[[Ollukaar]] - off with [[Mr. Bag Man]] head

[[Py]] starts attuning to the [[Teardrop Gemstone]] - EEEEK
