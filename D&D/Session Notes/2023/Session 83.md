Notices
Situation in [[Thraldur]]
[[Porthladd]] has allied with [[Gabel]]

[[Kingdom of Sordun]] is technically no more because idiots don't know what to do without a king
they also don't fully agree with the rule of the council of [[Thraldur]]

a blade singer steps in
	ive been informed that the reading of the book is now complete
	if you wish to be transported somewhere do let us know
	i had been told you had some interest in going to [[Gabel]]

Off to [[Ryllyren]] to sort out the kerfuffle 
but first the adventurers guild to get [[Ryder]] registered with the guild

[[Aranelle]] drinks the full vial of sleepy juice
[[Enva]] gets trashed - starts to float away - gets tied with some rope - is now a helium balloon

[[Ollukaar]] sees a shift in the show

[[Remmer Haze]] - arctic predator that thrive in cold climates
bodies immense heat of a furnace
somewhere between a millipede and a cobra

[[Remmer Haze]] AC -  15 hits
Not even 1 round - Pah!!!

Got some bits from it including a spine and 2 meals worth of food


Meanwhile - in [[Aranelle]]s head
	voice of [[Dendar]]
		Why dont you sit down?
		I will let you wake once we have struck a deal
		I have so much I can offer you
		what could you gain from some glorified dragon sitting ion his pedestal doing nothing of greatness
	
		The is much I can offer you
		especially with 1. especially with the item your party has (evil book)
        he was trying to persuade me to come to the darkness once more now that i made amends
	    and probably use said book

[[Aranelle]] so now, because I denied him once more, he gave me uncontrollable tremors and tics. I have disadvantage for str and dex saving throws

[[Ryder]] takes watch and sees long creepy arms pulling them selves out of [[Py]]s bad

[[Mr. Bag Man]] beastie is about 15ft tall

	shouts - "***MARVEL IN THE KINGDOM***"
AC - 15 hits --- 11 no hit

[[Py]] gets the [[Teardrop Gemstone]] out of its hand
[[Enva]] glues the monster to a giant boulder with some [[sovereign glue]]
as [[Pinecone]] bites him again we see that his previous wounds have stitched them selves back up
we see glowing red beads in his hands

he dropped beads from a necklace of fireballs

May have heard tales of a creature that lives in bags of holding, not sure what it was other then that

[[Ollukaar]] off with [[Mr. Bag Man]] head

[[Py]] starts attuning to the [[Teardrop Gemstone]] - eeek
