[[Py]]s having trouble with her bread
	*its about whether you want to make the bread*

[[Py]] *I wont meet my friend ever again, I dont want to talk about it*

[[Meg]] *The water brings back memories, but not necessarily your memories*

[[Py]] goes into the lake, it starts off calm. she holds the [[Teardrop Gemstone]] 
sees an unfamiliar woman
her hair flows like water - deep blue eyes
as she looks down
[[Py]]s view follows hers, she is looking at a large city
sees the city fall, large fires in the city, to darkness the destruction is a mystery
hears a loud shriek as a gargantuan creature
with 2 huge horns on its face. looks to be made of red adimantion
swipes at buildings toppling them
[[Turask]] <-- the creature
![[Pasted image 20230516231025.png]]
people fleeing on boats
fighters flying shooting and failing to kill the creature
Seems to be nothing that can stop it
She hears a muffled talking
her view turns and looks to the sky sees silhouettes
no one sees the silhouettes
they wave their arms, seem to be panicked
suddenly a calming feminine tone speaks

The [[Turask]] continues to destroy the city
every settlement you see get destroyed

Then the clouds shift
see days/nights fly by

East of Corin some boats make it to safety
time-lapse view of them building their towns and settlements
speed run history of the continent

hear a weeping - the sun blazes brightly
radiance fills the sky  and shimmers down across the continent
the boats turn back and return to where they came
1 drop of water hits the ocean and sinks deeper and deeper

[[Py]] awakens
feels relief but there is upset there also
there is also a taste of nostalgic longing


[[Ollukaar]] enters the pool
view drifts to an encampment belonging to his tribe
scale being held by his granny
7 reliquary's
she looks at each of them before stashing them away

back in time before the major settlements were created
the 7 reliquary's start to disappear 1 by 1
clock starts to go forward
on an overcast stormy day
their are ships arriving
he has not seen them before
only dragonborn, dwarves, a few other exist
humans on the ships
they seem fearful
a fight breaks out
the tribe leaves the humans - fleeing from the landing ships
sees a war break out between the ships that are landing
he hears the word [[Turask]]
sees a mass move in the sea, behind the ships
the humans don't seem to entirely trust the dragonborn
wars continue dragonborn taking sides
shifting of blame over the [[Turask]]
different humans taking their ships outside somewhere on the continent
the humans know draconic and different dialects of common
Eventually some human ships leave the continent
a few weeks pass, blinding light fills the sky
ships start turning back
the views shift, time passes, its passes from memory that humans were not on the continent at one point
tribe starts obtaining the scales
be they handed to them (wizard) or simply finding them
dragons supply them with the reliquaries
they were passed down from [[Bahamut]]
the tribe is not sure what to think at first 
but over time they see visions etc
one of the scales, obtained by one of the tribe, an early adventurer, a skilled warior, cunning, comes back with stories of a large gargantuan old dragon plucking the scale from his own body and handing it to the adventurer, identifying himself as [[Bahamut]] 
warrior stepping back from portal he found and the last scale they found

view shifts to the sky, see a single drop of water drop down into the ocean
also knows that skilled enough enchanter/craftsman the scale can change or be imbued to other items
As far as you can tell this has been left here by [[Bahamut]] for a purpose, but not sure what the ultimate purpose is


[[Piff]]
THERE IS SOMETHING I  DONT KNOW ABOUT THE DRAGONM HISTORY

also hear the crashing of waves etc....

the noise fades
going back in time

granny did have a reasonably normal life
but wanted to adventure
she meets a young man
Granddaddy
has patches of white scales on his neck
get the feeling he's not a dragon but there is something about him
an intense heat you feel, that quickly switches to an arctic cold
an instinct of survival was the coldness
a drive of greed and violence and power
a man who would do anything to achieve that
my view follows him
he does not seem to get much younger
he goes to cold mountains terrain
with him a group 
one seems to be drawing a map
other carry adventuring gear
the travel through this land get the se
not far from dwarven stronghold
head up into the 
seeking to map the continent
what can be mapped can be found
[[Grandad]] there for riches that can be found
they start to run out of rations
they did not face any beasts
sticking to quieter paths, traveling quietly
fought goblins, caught sight of a wormling
as everyone got hungry
that's when it started going wrong
arguments break out
others wanted to turn back
most wanted to just know what was there
[[Grandad]] not satisfied
waited till the cold night
he is on watch with another who is tired and drunk
once drunk enough, [[Grandad]] murdered the other guy on watch
killed the whole party
2 awoke, tried to defend themselves
too cold to fight 
eventually he had them all on a sled
eat them one
determined to trek to a stronghold
on his journey he encountered "MY RELATIVE" a white dragon
in this time it had only been a few years since the dragons appeared
white dragon swooped down - [[Grandad]] managed to bargain with it
dragon felt a kinship - a pact was forged between the two
as long as [[Grandad]] would feed the beast, telling him what he knew about the land - dragon would bestow draconic abilities
went out into the world with new powers

got to the gates of the stronghold
was not so foolish as to open the stronghold doors
he went back to civilisation
did not manage to get riches from the stronghold
managed to get them elsewhere
maybe the ice could be a city? 

[[Tardon]]
time passing back to a recent time
sees the war between elves & casters & king of [[Thraldur]] & [[Order of Valaar]]
sent out soldiers to meet the elves at the border in the halfling province
swift battle - elves wiped them out
remanence of magic on the fields causes the wild magic zone
spreading the magic - spreading decay
halflings return
form slums around the outside of [[Thraldur]]
halfling province stared to grow once more
ridding the arcane remanence
some damage still remained, the land not as fruitful as it once was
eventually you see a view of an old halfling
sitting down writing a book
seems to be a cleric
symbol of [[Pallor]] around his neck
seems to be a bit panicked - has just woken - scrawling a vision
same prophecy that has been passed to [[Tardon]] 
it found its way to/from human nobles in ....?? it made its way to [[Thraldur]] 
then it made its way by word of mouth to the cleric 
though it does seem to have been spread as a joke by nobles
the origin of it is not a joke
it could be instruction that could happen, but your not entirely sure
as you grow stronger as a cleric there will be things that mean he can restore land, food, etc
you get the feeling this is either a search for a wish or an artefact
image of golden cornucopia bashes in your head
arcane sidgils 
you feel while it can help and this could be what you're looking for at least one way to achieve what you set out to achieve
it can be used for the opposite if the wrong person found it
you get the feeling that this is not set in stone as this is not anything the prophecy mentioned, but its a way to do it
there is a way to achieve and fulfil the prophecy

***will add divine intervention can do nuts things***


[[Rusty]] & [[Py]] take water from the pool under the [[Big Willow]]

the PC who tried to forge the weapon could have found out about the [[Turask]] 

THIS YEAR IS 243
