To the TREEEEEEE

We afixed a brass plaque with the name "*Cart Blanche*" on it.
On the side of the #cart we painted
	*"No touchy, Property of the [[Thunder Fucks]]"*
Written on the side of the carrage

Into the woods heading north north west

Ghost wearing tattered white dress

#riddle
		*NNW from this ruined home  
		travel through terrain that will chill you to the bone  
		Once you've reached the highest peak  
		You must ascend until your knees grow weak*
Once you reach a certain point you will just keep taking damage from the ice and cold
Im sure i'll be seeing you again soon

a large [[Red Dragon]] killed the ghost
	when the dragons swooped back down on the land as a red dragon ....  
Killed the banshee, burned her
tree stumps around the house have not grown back
looks like this happened some time ago
about 100 years ago
the dragon is probably ancient by now

[[RED DRAGON]] name [[Thor-Ven-Dal]]

banshee name
Cara

[[Ollukaar]] dips me into the well
[[Piff]] hears
	you failed me from the [[Shadow Dragon]]

[[Ollukaar]] sees a gaunt pale dead looking face within the stove - its [[Kyburn]]

Run till morning
1 point of exhaustion
Find a little hovel, in it a baby dragon
Pushed lil #baby dragon into the well of wonder

[[Gargantuan Green Dragon]] 
	squeezes its head into the hovel
	dragon starts to speak
	Who has taken our child
	I know youre in there halfling
	halfling, you have one chance to tell me  
	what you have done with the smaller green dragon  
	before I loose my patience
		We're all alone out here
		the air stings more
		last chance!!!
	I am not a red dragon I can be reasonable  
	should you answer now  
	I can smell you in there

The [[Lych]] is in a stronghold up north
It is hidden
