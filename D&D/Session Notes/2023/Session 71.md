[[Enva]] & [[Bryne]] are very confused and does not remember us

[[Bryne]] is very rude. 

The shard that [[Py]]s conciousness was in is fucking with our heads

The [[Tear drop gem]] is salty and smells like the ocean

There are [[Skulks]] around the town, but they seem more interested in the town than us

[[Aracocra Settlement]] theres a tower with a precarious stone staircase
speaking with guards about #dragon #cave
Thick fog, constant rain and blizzards near it
Could be an icy wall blocking the entrance
they think they have seen a cave 72 miles NE of the settlement
will have to climb 100 ft up
the cave has "regional effects""

Theres hapenings in the [[Dark Forest]]. There might be a [[Fey]] issue. A bunch of [[Aracocra]] went and bought all the magic items in the [[Aracocra Settlement]]

a few [[Fey]] showed up to [[Thraldur]] and said they should be in charge

inform the [[Aracocra]] that it might be worth keeping an eye on the "abandoned keep" as it probably belongs to the [[Lych]]

Highest peak is near by the [[Aracocra Settlement]]

Something to do with a lost party member

[[Rusty]] thinks that we should cut [[Deckheads]] hands off for trying to take [[Aranelle]]s cloak

[[Ollukaar]] #quotes "***If they trimmed back some of these trees and foliage, it would make this mountain look a lot bigger***"

We are all tied together so if one person slipps off the mountain they dont fall to their deaths

Something wicked came along 1 day ago. found a body on the [[Big Mountain]]
Find 2, 8 legged tracks, only a few hours old, probably [[Basalisk]]s
