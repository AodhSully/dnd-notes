[[He Who walks on the wind]] - [[Ithica]] - [[Charlie]]s patron



Letter addressed to the [[Thunder Fucks]] has the seal of [[Valar]] on it
	Whenever we are finished out business in [[Ryllyren]] the queen requests our presence back in [[Valar]]

1 dread for [[Piff]]




fuck about with tying up [[Charlie]]

down the hole
into a chamber
large crystals shine dim blue light
no traps

theres sleek pillars through the centre of the room
large statue in the middle
pillars are very decerative
around them is a silver trellis
it surrounds each of the pillars
the trellis look slike webbing


statue is - spider goddess of the dark elves

there is a plack - cannot read it


you feel a light draft comming from a direction
the webs are actual webs

this place has not been tended to in quite some time

you hear a swift scutteling noise
we hear a thud back from where we came

smaller than the statue is the creature that 

half purple elf half black spider
	greeting surface dweller
	that entry has not been used for quite some time
	what business have you in our ladys temple
	"under-cousin"

there is an entrance to the under dark down here
they failed to siege the high elves
