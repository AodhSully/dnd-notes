During the night [[Py]] attunes to the [[Teardrop Gemstone]] #vision
	Drifts off
	sees ripples in the water
	looks into water
	sees long hair feminine face
	cant make out who it is
	she lifts up a hand and waves at [[Py]]
	her vision is pulled away from her body as she looks at herself
	fly's over [[Gabel]]
	looks like how you think it would look today
	see barricade of ships in the bay
	see a hulking dark silhouette in the water
	none of the ships are taking notice of it
	gentile waves follow its body
	it seems to stop as it gets to the shore
	vision then moves closer to the city
	as it plunges into the water
	turns to look to the coast
	no sign of any creature, no tracks
	you get the same sensations as when she uses prime evil awareness
	thinks this might be like detect magic
	looks deeper into the ocean towards the coast
	then gets a look at it
	seems to resemble a creature that is curled up in foetal position
	creature is gargantuan, terrifying
	seems to have burrowed into the earth
	its sleeping, waiting
	you hear a muffled "boom" as there's ripples on the water above
	see fire over surface of water
	looks back to see creature stirring from slumber for a moment
	everything goes still again
	Then look out toward the ocean
	the sun stops piercing through
	the sky becomes dark overhead
	you start to feel unsettled
	strange sensation at your ears
	start to hear a whisper calling to you
	"secrets, would you like to know more"
	before you're puled from the water
	you open your eyes and back to reality

Whatever whispered did not feel like that of when she attuned

4 hours to [[Ryllyren]] to [[Casa Del Piffington]]

we reach the gates of [[Ryllyren]] 
sees half elf guard aims crossbow
village = my family and their workers
[[Ieoff]] - is the guard, he's new here, he's a bit rude


[[Ryllyren]]
	is in the mountain
	extends to a cliff edge
	on a flat portion
	ease of access to the mountain
	does not seem to be chipped away at
	mining does not happen in the town itself
	House is on the edge of a cliff
	moderate guard barracks
	dungeon
	a bathhouse not far from the gates
	some houses/cottages scattered around
	start to form a street or two eventually
	nice general store
	over by the ledge as you go down the 1 main street
	you see a manor, some may sat precariously perched
	nice balconies view out over the valley
	a perch you can walk out on to
	fences around what would be the garden
	2 carriages parked out front
	nice big cursive letters over the gate that say Piffington


The 2 guards at the gate to the estate [[Godfrey]] [[Manfried]]
Why are you here

[[Godfrey]] spits at [[Ollukaar]]

The cliff is coming away -  its very precarious

[[Casa Del Piffington]]
	we approach the manor
	its built of stone
	nice Icey embellishment
	6 pillars out front
	over the door a depiction of white dragon
	parts of the house look like they made of ice
	house has been there a while
	there's 3 floors including loft and high peaked roof
	2 towers at the back at each corner of the house
	inside: there's a rug rolled out
	not what you would expect of a manor or palace
	its a pelt - stitched together - some sort of white pelt
	looks nice and neat

icy door knob turns, door swings open
old lady have not met opens the door

old lady thinks im [[Charlie]] or [[Snowden]]

ice everything in the house

They throw children over the edge to pick things up, but they bring them back up

a double stairwell a few feet from entry
as it splits into 2 to go to each side it looks a bit snake like, not quite winding
it breaks off into 2
snakes up like someone would draw branches of a tree
a little steep
there are many many doors to accommodate the large family that lives here
few suits of armour, some made of ice


[[Ryder]] tries to slide down the stairs on a shield
one of the suits of armour seems to be sentient

quick visit to [[mumsie]]
up the NE tower

[[mumsie]] hunched over a stool painting 

painting of clouds

Sometimes there's noise at night

[[Enva]] trying to rob the family jewels
inside the room is a study
bookshelves 
desk 
looks out over the valley

[[Enva]] reads the [[Grandad]]s journal: #Archibalds_Journal
	The adventurers went from [[Crystwy]] into the [[Northern Mountains]] through the forest
	a long trek through woods following the river
	seem to be reasonably peaceful
	met some forest species along the way without issue
	started to head NW at the base of the mountains
	reach more snow covered terrain, 
	seem to have got a bit lost along the way
	during tha time they decided to head west following the base of the mountains
	heard there was a large river that would bring them to [[Dwarven Stronghold]]
	however the didn't anticipate the number of monsters they would come across
	had to his a lot, this set them back
	putting them off track even more
	they then realised the rations started to run low
	they started to cut back on eating, smaller rations
	this did not work well for all
	Archibald's mind starts to became a bit warped as he continues to write
	decides they need to fins an [[Aracocra]] settlement
	they tried to hunt something that would not be a peril to them
	one night, he noted dhe started to hear strange sounds
	strange whispers calling to him
	he ventured a bit from the camp while on watch, never found anything
	one night when he returned to camp, he decided he had enough of the hunger
	this whole trip was his idea, he was in charge of the food
	perhaps it would be better if he made it back by himself
	he would not have to share as much funds if he came back with the map on his own
	if that's what his gut is saying.. it could only be the right thing
	while the rest of the party slept, he stared to poison the little food that was lleft
	he would wait till the next night, watched them all eat their fill
	he notes how they all started to cough and wobble
	one hobbled into the snow
	the other 2 try to steady each other
	he took this opportunity to take his blade and slaughter them
	what he didn't anticipate was coming across "him"
	goes on to describe this great beastly majestic white dragon
	primitive but powerful
	at first the dragon swiped, saw what Archie had done and hesitated
	it seemed intrigued
	he had then told the dragoon about the whispers and his plan for profits
	the dragon admired his ambition or his actions, not sure which, but the dragon spared him
	infact they formed a pact
	you see the name [[Barocthaar]] in the journal
	the same name on the blade next to his own
	the dragon told him
		should he bring more to these mountains and offer them to him, he would give him treasures in order to aid in his pact
		he details how he brought a few adventuring parties into the mountains
		making sure no one was too armed
		in the right circumstances he could easily take out these parties
		sometimes he would leave some alive so the dragon could hunt the rest for sport
		eventually he was awarded the dagger
		started to try gather more challenging beasts for the whit dragon to hunt along woth other he found that were like him
		in exchange for this he was given another item... the broch 
		eventually, as he grew older he stopped going to the mountains
		initially he came to this side of the continent to gather more info on a silver dragon he had heard of, but that's when he met [[Grandmother]]
		he kept putting off going back to the mountains, still gathering info
		the then left granny promising his return, but he knew that wasnt the case
		in that time they had amassed enough wealth to build the manor
		it was not as large back then
	, didn't have the towers
	feeling like he wouldn't return but hoping he would he left his journal and the 2 items
	not sure if he had more or if he left them hoping he could get something better
	he refers to dagger as dragons wrath
	broch as an ornament
	
intention with the silver dragon was to kill it
he mentioned perhaps getting power from both

[[Enva]] starts to hear what she thinks is a gentile breeze at first
but then turns inti words, whisper
	Sooooo many secrets
	secrets give power
	the right secret could topple a kingdom
	unravel sanity
	you seem to enjoy gathering secrets
	you seem to understand its not nessecaraly bad
	ill let you in on a little secret of my own
	something you don't want to loose
	you should look at what they gave you
	a brief image of an item comes into your mind
before you feel the presence slipping away
	if you don't someone else truly will
there's a strange familiarity to it for a moment

you cant quite put a finger on who it is, its just familiar

Whistle to [[Ollukaar]]
