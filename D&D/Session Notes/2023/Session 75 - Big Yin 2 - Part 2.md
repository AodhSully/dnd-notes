[[Tardon]] finds out that there was nothing too strange going on in [[Gabel]] in a message from his temple


[[Ollukaar]] pops his head through the well of many worlds
sees a big cave filled with crystals


In the [[Crystal Cave]] there's a big [[Red Crystal Dragon]] - looks like hes made of rubys
They are in the "quasi elemental plane of mineral"
Can shapeshift, looks like [[Marcelle Duchamps]] then shapeshifted into [[Ollukaar]]

[[Red Crystal Dragon]] is now wandering round [[Thraldur]]

We all see a flash of white (those of us not in the portal)

There's an [[Aracocra]] asks about the board
	Were selling art

[[Mindarion]] takes a bow, billows his cloak and fucks off

Everyone back out of the portal, we now in [[Porthladd]]

There is one ship with the crest of [[Gabel]] in the bay

[[Capitan Dunbar]]s ship = [[Dormonds Charter]]
[[Court of Themus]] fucks already in [[Porthladd]]

[[Jock]] gets ripped off at the market
the shield he gets is sentient


[[Enva]] and [[Luthien]] go invisible and fly over to the [[Court of Themus]] ship that is docked in the bay of [[Porthladd]]

on the ship there is a ballista at the front and back, there are 2 catapults
lots of hatches on the side of the ship, some for oars, others for presumably cannons
about 20 people on the deck
likely more below deck
a few people with the blue robes of he [[Court of Themus]]
the two girls land on the ship 
no one pays any attention 
most are resting and playing games
most likely waiting for the [[Court of Themus]] that we saw on shore
there is a hatch that leads to the lower decks

Few people asking where all the vampires went from [[Thraldur]] if they are not in [[Gabel]]
Some are eager to get back to [[Gabel]]
Some are wondering what the magistrate is discussing with the local noble

in-between some of the benches theres... some benches are missing
in their spot there are cannons, 3 on each side

They took AGES and found the shitter

They got rumbled!!!

Theres a ruckus on the docks, horns are blaring
[[Grom]] summons a water elemental and gets it to attack the [[Court of Themus]] ship


Theres some mer-people appear after he drops the ship like moses
Elemental tries to take [[Tardon]] away

[[Ollukaar]] and [[Talfin]] fly away after [[Talfin]] banishes a guard
[[Tardon]] and [[enva]] fly away from the archers

[[Ollukaar]] and [[Talfin]] get taken to a barracks
[[Ollukaar]] gets taken away for questioning

Chat in the ship - [[Grom]] is not pleased
[[Enva]] goes for a dip under water, [[Tardon]] cannot go underwater

[[Tardon]] walks to the ship with the guards following him then starts walking out to sea on the water
[[Piff]] Freezes the incoming wave, saved everyone on the ship and on the shore
