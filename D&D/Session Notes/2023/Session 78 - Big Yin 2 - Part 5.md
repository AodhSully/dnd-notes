[[Deckheads]] currently out to sea
[[Thunder Fucks]] after a hurricane on the way to port in [[Ythyri]]

[[Tardon]] has a vision
	I apologise for the delayed communication
	it seems my messenger encountered a bit of a predicament
	you are [[Tardon]] of course, of the halflings
	is there something in particular you would like to ask of me

[[Tardon]] - I am torn, I have never killed so many in your name and I may have to do more, I need to be sure that is what you want to vanquish the evil of the court
	[[Pallor]] - While you have done great deeds such as the liberation of the city of [[Thraldur]]
	it is my belief that in that battle it is only evil that were struck down
	however, the last act of yours that drew attention from the outer planes was worrisome 
[[Tardon]] - They were your enemies
	[[Pallor]] - I cannot be certain that they were, or weren't
	your friends got away safely
	how can you be so sure that everyone on the ship was in fact in allegiance with the [[Court of Themus]] 
	what about the rest of the crew, the deck hands, sailors etc
	should there be a full battle by all means defend yourself
[[Tardon]] - surprise attack is the idea
	[[Pallor]] - There were some of the crew within the city of [[Porthladd]] were innocent
	before completely destroying the, try to at least have some inkling or confirmation that they have evil intent, at the least
[[Tardon]] - Don't worry I'm not as deviating on land
	[[Pallor]] - and should it come to it, if there is opportunity for repentance from their members, if possible try to save those that you can


[[Court of Themus]] 2 in a row boat head out to the [[Deckheads]]
[[Deckheads]] get rescued and brought to a custom house
[[Deckheads]] have 3 exhaustion points

[[Luthien]] taken away to be questioned
she's from [[Thraldur]] is part of the [[Deckheads]]
[[Luthien]] lies about where the ship was heading she said they were heading for an island called [[Soup]]
guard does not think the timeline lines up for the arcane storm

the interrogation does not go well for the [[Deckheads]]

[[Mindarion]] starts to draw a teleportation circle
	whoever wants to join me can come too
	
nearly everyone makes it through except [[Jock]] & [[Luthien]]
[[Luthien]] blinks out and makes it to [[Mindarion]]s teleportation circle but does not make it through

[[Deckheads]] now in [[Valar]] 

[[Ythyri]] is set on some cliffs - like cliffs of moher
lil bit of land at the bottom
mountains on top

there is a small port for small boats

the barkeep in [[Ythyri]] seems concerned about something out to sea

[[Aranelle]] casts detect thoughts
	he is thinking of crashing waves, ships sank
	a large mass in the water

danger in the water 
Ships crew start singing.
[[Ollukaar]] flies towards the ship
[[Aranelle]] dimension door over to the ship

The see among the choppy waves there's a concentrated mass of water that gets calm once it nears the ship

[[Ollukaar]] dives in the water and sees big fish creatures, they try to speak to him, he does not understand

[[Deep Ones]]

they speak in common
	[[Deep Ones]] - who are you?
[[Ollukaar]] I am Olly, dragonborn, we mean you no harm, if you mean us no harm
	[[Deep Ones]] - Why do you come into the ocean
[[Ollukaar]] - I was on a vessel and was concerned for the safety of the crew
	
[[Aranelle]] and the crew jump in the water and are surrounded by the Deep Ones
[[Aranelle]] magic missiles 8 of the [[Deep Ones]]

[[Ollukaar]] - "***Bring it fucking fishy bitches***"
