At the [[Big Willow]]. The armour that the people are wearing has a sigl of a willow tree with an eye 

Name of the white dragon [[Piff]]s [[Grandad]] swore fealty to is [[Barocthaar]]

[[Meg]] is a deity (of sorts) 
	but only because people want to me
	[[Peg]] is a clone of [[Meg]]
[[Meg]] is a personification of chaos

make shrines to [[Meg]]
there is one in [[Rocknest]]
just include the symbol/sigl
	I am not a deity of law or will
	Use your judgement

[[Meg]]s commandments
1. Only dip biscuits into warm tea

[[Meg]] fixes [[Aranelle]]s old issue

Where we going?
[[Duke of Beldor]] wants us in [[Thraldur]]
We step into the pool at the [[Big Willow]] and get transported back to [[Thraldur]]

[[Magic Horsie]]
we see something soaring overhead
looks like a huge unicorn
this creature seems to look like a horse but with shimmering gold scales and a pearlescent horn
it mane and tail are pure white
powerful creatures can cast up to 9th level [[Ki-Ran]]
found in the outer planes celestial lawful good
counterbalance to forces of evil

water glows bright, all you see is the [[Ki-Ran]] floats overhead and the [[Big Willow]]

Poof! we back in [[Thraldur]]

remember [[Meg]] talked to you
remember climbing the mountain
don't remember how you got to the [[Big Willow]]
get the feeling you're being watched, not malevolent
just someone is observing

[[Aranelle]] back to normal - disguises the cloak as her normal clothes

We walk to the gates, there is a crowd of people forming a line waiting to get in
they have been waiting a good few days
there has been a bit of a scare
want to make sure that there's no undead or [[Court of Themus]] people getting in
there was a letter addressed to the council which is posted on the gate

Letter from [[Gabel]]
	Members of the Council,
	It has come to our attention that the previous Lord Magistrate, [[Aquilo Melenos]], was beheaded while overseeing the city of [[Thraldur]]. However, it has also been brought to our attention that there were those within our Court that, to put lightly, did not strive to uphold the aspects of [[Lady Themis]].
	On behalf of the remaining _true_ acolytes of the court, I would like to formally apologise to the members of the council and the citizens for which they stand. We feel no hatred toward Thraldur for the murder of Aquilo Melenos and the destruction of our temple within the city. The [[Court of Themus]] remains the ruling power over the city of [[Gabel]], the citizens here have come to understand that what happened was the actions of a traitor in our ranks. We shall endeavour to uphold the values of [[Lady Themis]] and restore order here in [[Gabel]], seeking out what remains of those wretched creatures of the night and dispatching of them with the help of our inquisitors. I write this today on the day of the winter solstice as an olive branch for the dark days ahead of us. If we are to dispose of what remains of these night crawlers we must come together as one and trust one another.
	Sincerely,
	Lord Magistrate [[Laios Mentoros]]  
	High Priest of the [[Court of Themus]]


[[Piff]] casts ray of frost on the ground, Soldier slips and falls

we get approached by another guard at the gate

[[Bryne]] is from west of [[Thraldur]]
	I'm from west of here

We detect 2 undead trying to get in, 1 gets vaporised
the 1 vaporised was an innocent

We enter the city, after the incident

The [[Kings Head Inn]] is refurbished

Since the city guard has been decimated it seems that they have made some adventurers into guards


We meet [[Gil]] in the [[Adventurers guild]] while looking for [[Antigone]]
Best enchanters is in the upper district
[[Mildred Hopsockle]] is a gnome - is a good enchanter
Will see a sign with a big gem

Acolyte of [[Nemesis]] is thumped to the ground, dragged back up and the guards shout at him to follow then 
His name is [[Dardon 2]]
The robes are similar to the [[Court of Themus]] but they are a reddish blue (GRAPE Coloured Robes)
He seems to have a symbol around his neck of scales, however this one has a whip 
he is an acolyte of [[Nemesis]]  
	*Goddess of retribution & revenge, sometimes envy
	it was retribution and revenge against undue deeds
	Its the angry side of [[Court of Themus]]
	they mainly target the evil side of things*

The [[Thraldur]] Guards name is [[Craysos]] is a bit of a dick
[[Craysos]] was with the adventurer group [[The Clashing Mauls]]


We head into the temple of [[Bahamut]], hear chanting, we reach the main chamber
everything fixed up since the battle 1 month ago
See a banner of the platinum dragon

One of the priest type dragonborn approaches [[Ollukaar]]
he is armour clad 
seems to be [[Pandrin]]
	no many dragonborn is [[Thraldur]]
	no one came to claim the temple so we set up for a while here
	to guard the reliquary
We see the reliquary at the back of the temple

[[Ollukaar]] speaks to [[Pandrin]] about the discovery of the relics of [[Bahamut]] that he saw in the vision at the [[Big Willow]]
Tell him of the arrival of humans to the continent
Tells him of the [[Turask]] - "A mighty beast, big as a mountain, like a very angry turtle, I believe it may have followed the humans here."
[[Pandrin]] "I believe it may have attacked by now"
[[Ollukaar]] "unless it slumbers"
[[Ollukaar]] tells of the [[Ancient Green Dragon]] in the [[Northern Mountains]] and pushing its baby into the well of many worlds


Wander along into the wealthy district
lots of buildings turned to rubble
Some of the shops are open
One of them is [[Mildred Hopsockle]]s shop *"Mildred's Magnificent ....... "*

[[Mildred Hopsockle]] is a small gnome with a red pointed hat?
smashes kitchen scale on the counter as she listens to [[Ollukaar]]

speaks of chromatic and GEM dragons?

Might be able to make potions to turn us into dragons

Meet [[Antigone]] in the Palace
she is not happy about our meddling in how the city is being run during the day


Told [[Antigone]] that [[Enva]] missed her and she would not stop talking about her on the trip up the [[Northern Mountains]]


### Message to Grom: 
_Super secret important mission for the duke of Beldor. In Thraldur, on our way to Gable, saw a twin carriage. BTW Jock smells of...._ 
message cuts off

### Message from Grom:
*"We're in Thraldur, we asked him for help with that. Were do you want to meet us, much to talk about"*

[[Solace]] contacted [[Antigone]] about the [[Duke of Beldor]]s plan 
[[Ollukaar]] casts detect undead within the council chamber, no jiggery pokery amongst the council

Some lord and lady guests [[Fey]] within [[Thraldur]] 

[[Ollukaar]] asks about the [[Fey]] issue we hear about at the [[werewolf camp]]
 *"we are in discussions"*
	before you go, due to the gratitude the city owes you
	im going to gently warn you
	Do not obliterate people

[[Tardon]] asks [[Brian]] how things are going
he still has his apron under is shirt

[[Ollukaar]] is no longer welcome in the court of the council

[[Piff]] casts prestidigitation over [[Enva]]s head while she looks at [[Antigone]] to make tiny hearts bubble up from her head
