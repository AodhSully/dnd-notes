[[rusty]] finds 3 acolites

[[Ollukaar]] executes the book shopkeep

We travelled through the dark forest. We were followed by night mares who stopped the carriage. [[Piff]] got out and got surrounded and attacked by demons. [[Py]] stepped out and got surrounded and attacked by demons. [[Ollukaar]] got attacked by a night mare which took off his left hand. We managed to kill them and continued. When we were almost out of the forest we got stopped by talking trees. [[Py]] sensed dragons so the trees were asked about it and they recently saw a green dragon around. Aranelle also told the group that her snake was a fiend as [[py]] thought they were still following us. We got to [[Pathcross]] and got a rest, but we saw there were 3 acolytes of the  [[Court of Themus]] there. The next morning [[ollukaar]] and the group went to the bookshop. [[Rusty]] split from the group to go to check potions or something. 
[[Ollukaar]] warned the acolytes who were walking around that he was going to interrogate the owner of the bookshop and they sent one of them in with us. He cast zone of truth and started questioning him. Turned out he was following the green dragon and had no regrets. [[Ollukaar]] took out his weapon. Now all 3 acolytes tried to command him to stop but they failed as [[Ollukaar]] decapitated the bookshop owner.
