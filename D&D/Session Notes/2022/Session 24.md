Creepy cold child upstairs
Creepy hover child

Portal to the [[Shadow Realm]]

Have 11 [[skulks]]

[[Ollukaar]] finds a pendant on the Innkeeper
in the shape of a spider

Feel a sting up my arm
Body grows heavy

Voice from the portal
Voice from the void
scaled one, discard the artifact and throw it into the void
it will only bring you ruin

[[Raven Queen]]
I go by many names
Mother of ravens
Matrin of death
i'm trying to help you
just cast the blade into the darkness
you can step through if you wish
and return from whence you came
I do not seek to harm you
Feel an overwhelming sense of fear from
shadow dragon blade
cast him into the darkness

Steps in to the portal [[Shadow Realm]]

They'll be fine as long as they don't get lost
still in the cellar but its darker, damper
vines covering the Inn

starless sky - Blank black sky
I'm no one, just a Humble servant ---
Mother of ravens
Matron of death
a fragment of another servant who was cast out for his misdeeds
seems that he found another way to live on
he was a #dragon
he sought power from our plain
but he decided he would use it in a sacrilegious way
so he had to be removed


"Servant"
Village between [[Eldor]] & [[Ilrund]]
The upside down
Black leather, chains hanging from wrists
DEAD
