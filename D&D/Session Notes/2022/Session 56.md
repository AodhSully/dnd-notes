Letter to [[Piff]]s mum
	Hi Mumsie dearest    
	How are you? I am fine.  
	Travels have been fun, I made new firends we killed a dragon and Im learing to freeze more and more things as the days go by  
	Two quick things:  
	1. Due to a minor mishap, that was nobodies fault, can you do a double delivery to the high elfs next time and only charge for one  
	Queeney got me out of a bind and I said you would sort them out  
	2. We may have started a small holy war with some vampires  
	Hugs and kisses  
	Piff
