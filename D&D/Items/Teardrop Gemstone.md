Held [[Py]]s consciousness at one point

[[Py]] has attuned to it 
	During the night [[Py]] attunes to the [[Teardrop Gemstone]] #vision
	Drifts off
	sees ripples in the water
	looks into water
	sees long hair feminine face
	cant make out who it is
	she lifts up a hand and waves at [[Py]]
	her vision is pulled away from her body as she looks at herself
	fly's over [[Gabel]]
	looks like how you think it would look today
	see barricade of ships in the bay
	see a hulking dark silhouette in the water
	none of the ships are taking notice of it
	gentile waves follow its body
	it seems to stop as it gets to the shore
	vision then moves closer to the city
	as it plunges into the water
	turns to look to the coast
	no sign of any creature, no tracks
	you get the same sensations as when she uses prime evil awareness
	thinks this might be like detect magic
	looks deeper into the ocean towards the coast
	then gets a look at it
	seems to resemble a creature that is curled up in foetal position
	creature is gargantuan, terrifying
	seems to have burrowed into the earth
	its sleeping, waiting
	you hear a muffled "boom" as there's ripples on the water above
	see fire over surface of water
	looks back to see creature stirring from slumber for a moment
	everything goes still again
	Then look out toward the ocean
	the sun stops piercing through
	the sky becomes dark overhead
	you start to feel unsettled
	strange sensation at your ears
	start to hear a whisper calling to you
	"secrets, would you like to know more"
	before you're puled from the water
	you open your eyes and back to reality
