#### Oraculum

_Wondrous item, artefact (requires attunement)_

---

This ornamental silvered weapon was evidently not made by any smith among men. The blade hums gently as you grip the hilt.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 
You can use a bonus action to activate the weapon, targets damaged with this weapon will then take an additional 1d6 points of force damage. 

It has the following additional properties:

- **Sentience.** [[Oraculum]] is a sentient chaotic-neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 12. 
- It has hearing and dark vision out to 120 feet. 
- The weapon can speak, read, and understand 
	- [[Common]], 
	- [[Elvish]], and 
	- [[Primordial]]. 
	- In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with its wielder. 
	- Its voice is light and echoing. 
	- While you are attuned to it, [[Oraculum]] also understands every language you know.
- **Personality.** [[Oraculum]] speaks in a gentle, wise voice. Sometimes speaking in vatic utterances. 
- The artefact's purpose is to guide those who are lost along their journey through life. 
- Should its wielder do anything that may harm the island or its peaceful inhabitants, it may no longer speak and its magical properties shall fade away. 
- The artefact also prefers neutral or good characters. Oraculum may change its appearance depending on the wielder's preferences. It may also change form.
- **Destroying the Artefact.** Oraculum can only be destroyed by its wielder travelling to the ethereal plane. You must travel from [[Corin]] to the island of [[Llanaumar]] and have it destroyed by a powerful deity of good or neutral alignment.

While [[Oraculum]] is on your person, 
- you have advantage on initiative rolls. 
- In addition, you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. 
- [[Oraculum]] awakens you if you are sleeping naturally when a combat begins.
