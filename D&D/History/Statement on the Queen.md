# Royal Council of Tiirynur

#### Dated the Nineteenth Day of the Month Blossom and Fire, the Year Two-Hundred and Fourty-Three Arcane Restoration

### Public Proclamation of the Deposition of Her Majesty, [[Queen Aspen Solarin]] of the [[Kingdom of Tiirynur]]

Citizens of [[Tiirynur]],

Since our arrival on this land our nation, if not our entire species, has been represented by the monarchy of our prosperous kingdom. Her Majesty, [[Queen Aspen Solarin]], has often taken the advice of her royal council into consideration and has in the past scorned those who would suggest rash actions while taking the good of all peoples into mind.

However, the [[Royal Council of Tiirynur]] has recently seen that Her Majesty, [[Queen Aspen Solarin]], has disregard for the diplomatic relations our kingdom maintains among others and therefore disregard for the safety of its people, along with despotic tendencies, and at times a penchant for sadism.

**The charges against Her Majesty are as follows:**

- **Tyranny and Oppression.** Her Majesty has at times ruled with an iron fist, using whatever means necessary to achieve Her goals, suppressing any display of dissent, and favouring harsh punishments whenever possible.- **Reckless Disregard of Diplomatic Relations.** Her Majesty has attempted to engage in secretive arrangements that the council deem to be against the interest of the kingdom and would risk its security, and possibly the reputation of the crown.- **Assaulting an Official.** Upon attempting to take Her Majesty into custody peacefully, She resisted, assaulting guards and officials involved in the deposition process. Inflicting harm and showing disregard for law and order.

Due to these recent transgressions we believe that the Royal Council had no choice but to have Her Majesty arrested and deposed from her position on the throne. Initially, we had intended to offer Her Majesty safe passage out of our kingdoms borders but due to actions upon her attempted arrest we had no choice but to imprison Her until a court trial can be arranged.

We still have faith in our system of rulership and traditional values and as such the monarchy will remain. Once Her Royal Highness, [[Princess Lyara Solarin]], comes of age she will take her place as Queen of [[Tiirynur]]. However, until that day a member of the council will serve as Regent of our kingdom.

We urge our citizens to remain calm and united during these trying times. This unprecedented action is taken in the best interest for the future of our kingdom. We remain ever your faithful servants.

### Duly Signed

His Royal Majesty, [[King Rowan Silveroak]] of [[Llwyrnau]]

Arcane Luminary, [[Lord Halidris Ofandriel]], Archmage of [[Valar]]

Her Divine Eminence, [[Lady Claiiyra Siilydaal]], High Cleric of [[Valar]]

Divine Champion, [[Lord Erwiin Ailvard]], High Paladin of [[Valar]]
