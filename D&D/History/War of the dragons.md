before there was time without dragons
there was a war with orc armies laid seige on dwarves and elves
a form of aliance between #cromatic #dragon
to try and salvage the war the wizzards used an orb that case some sort of  
demi plane that trapped a large amount of dragons in the plane for a number of years  
until they were then released by the #shaddow #dragon
