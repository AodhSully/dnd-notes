Once the elves arrived on [Isle of Corin](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nifaalar-arborisyl/a/isle-of-corin-article) they began to look for suitable locations for their kin to settle. The high-elves looked north, to the mountains on the western coast of the island. The large forest along the border between the western and eastern half of the continent seemed a very fitting location for the wood-elves, where they could be enveloped in nature.
